	<h2>1) Get Organized</h2>
	<p class="main-text">In middle school, it’s easy to get away with disorganization. In high school, with six different classes all over the campus, strange new schedules, and a bunch of people you’ve never met before, organization is key to staying sane! Buy sticky notes, a few three-ring binders with dividers, notebooks, highlighters…whatever it takes to keep you on track! Also, those calendar organizers (or reminder binders, as my school calls them) that are given out at the beginning of the school year are more crucial than they appear. You can write down all your homework and assignments in them, and they’ll be a life-saver to you for the rest of high school…so make sure to use them!</p>
